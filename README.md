# Make the Most of Your Codecademy Membership

#### Learn about the different features Codecademy has to offer!

Codecademy has helped [tens of millions of people](https://www.codecademy.com/learner-stories) to learn to code, <br>
everything from **hello world** to getting new tech jobs, but when it comes down to it, you get out what you put in. <br>
If you want to be best set up for success, this guide is for you.

## Valuable Resources

There are hundreds of hours of free content on Codecademy, and thousands of hours of material available with our paid plans; <br>
but no matter your membership level, the key to success is learning intelligently. <br>
If you build the habits to use our features, it will be easier for you to master technical skills.

### Mobile App

Keep practicing and stay sharp as you go with our free mobile app on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-pro/id1376029326?ls=1&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryzac.codecademygo).

### Workspaces

[Workspaces](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/workspaces) allow learners to work in their own [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) right inside Codecademy. <br>
Build or try whatever you want for free with these unguided sandboxes, share your code, or keep it private. <br>
Not sure what to make? Grab code from your coursework and use it as a template.

### Cheatsheets

Coding is less about memorization and more about understanding principles; <br>
cheatsheets help you quickly refresh your memory and get back to work. <br>
You can find them linked in lessons, or head to their [homepage](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/cheatsheets/all) to find them all, broken down by the course section in which you learned them.

### Docs

Cheatsheets are a handy companion for consuming coursework, <br>
but when coding in the real world, programmers need documentation. <br>
With [Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs), you have an entirely open-source, free reference material to cover far more than a course can.

### Learn What to Learn

Not certain what language to pick up or what career path to choose? <br>
Flick through the [Learn What to Learn course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-what-to-learn), <br>
where we’ve consolidated the best resources to help you make a choice with confidence. <br>
An hour of planning now could save you days of wasted effort later.

There is also an excellent [forum post](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/guide-essential-things-to-know-about-coding-from-day-one/394538)
by Galina, one of our curriculum developers, <br>
that discusses how to best get started when beginning your coding journey.

### Community

Learning to code is challenging, but it’s easier if you can team up. <br>
Ask questions, stay connected, and find motivation with multiple communal experiences through Codecademy:

- [Community forum](https://discuss.codecademy.com/): ask and answer questions about anything on Codecademy.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/codecademy): chat in real-time with other learners across the globe.
- [Chapters](https://community.codecademy.com/): find like-minded people in your area and learn to code together. <br>
  There are even multiple virtual-first groups to join if you don’t find one nearby.
- [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/codecademy.community/): discuss the broader world of coding with tens of thousands of other learners.
- [30-Day Challenge](https://www.codecademy.com/30daychallenge): join others in a sprint to make progress and make learning a habit.

### Video Library

Need a break from the IDE but still want to be productive? <br>
Watch hundreds of educational and motivational video content on everything <br>
from basic coding concepts to career advice, all on-topic and [on-platform](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/videos).

## Paid Features

If you want to supercharge your learning, <br>
a paid plan may be right for you — here are some of our most popular paid features.

### Paths

[Skill Paths](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/all) and [Career Paths](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/new) are step-by-step roadmaps
that take you through <br> what you need to learn a specific skill or transition to a specific career in tech. <br>
They’ll tell you what to learn and in what order, cutting out the guesswork and to the chase. <br>
Career Paths cover everything that you’ll find in a $15,000 boot camp curriculum, plus more, <br>
and you can team up to tackle them with a [cohort group](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/career-path-groups/). <br>
Pro learners also get access to Interview Prep Skill Paths.

### Projects, Challenge Projects, and Portfolio Projects

As you learn, you’ll work on guided projects to put the things you’re learning to use. <br>
You’ll find a variety of project types. <br>
Some offer step-by-step guidance while others offer more of a challenge <br> by only describing the final outcome of the project. <br>
If you take a Path, you’ll build your own [Portfolio Projects](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/portfolio-projects-in-career-paths/) as well, designed to simulate professional coding tasks. <br>
The solutions to these portfolio projects will be unique to you! <br>
Check out all the projects available to you via the [Projects Library](https://www.codecademy.com/projects).

### Interview prep

If you’re taking one of our Career Paths, you’ll find interview prep essentials built-in. <br>
Learn interview techniques to prepare for technical interviews, including algorithm and data structure practice. <br>
Go even further with [dedicated skill paths](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/interview-prep) on acing the interview across a range of languages and disciplines.

### Practice & Review

With your Pro membership, you’ll find it easier to brush up on what you’ve learned. <br>
Choose for yourself what to practice with links from each module of your coursework. <br>
Or let us take the guesswork out with smart practice. <br>
Click the practice session link from syllabi and AI will prioritize concepts for you <br>
by using spaced repetition — a [scientifically proven](https://www.codecademy.com/article/spaced-repetition) way of helping you memorize new ideas.

### Quizzes

Test yourself as you make your way through a Path or course. <br>
Quizzes help you retain all the things you’re learning — plus, <br>
they’ll help you feel confident that you’re mastering the material.

### Certificates

When you complete a Pro course, you’ll earn a certificate. <br>
You can share it on your resume or your LinkedIn profile to showcase your skills or prepare for your job search.

<img src="./assets/Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 10.19.29 AM.png" alt="Example certificate" width="600" height="300">

In select career paths, we also offer professional certifications. <br>
In these paths, you’ll earn a professional certification for passing all of the exams in the path.

### Code Challenges

With technical interviews (and coding in general), practice makes perfect. <br>
Now, you can practice real code challenges from actual interviews to see how your skills stack up, <br>
or just solve them for fun. If you get stuck, we’ll point you to what you still need to learn. <br>
Code challenges are available with Pro.

## Conclusion

If you made it this far, you’re a highly motivated learner - we’re excited to see how far you’ll go, <br>
and hope some of the features you learned about today help. <br>
